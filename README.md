# Impact_of_COVID19_-on_-Counties
Using Python coding, I analyzed how COVID 19 can affect different counties and further analyzed how certain ages and other categories such as sex ratio is affected by COVID 19

## Background
This year, the pandemic, COVID 19, recently spread across the United States causing severe injuries and deaths. Thus, we can ask which US counties are most vulnerable based on population demographics and hospital bed availability?

## Data 

With [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19),[US Census](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2018/demo/popest/2018-fips.html), [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), [American Community Service](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=United%20States&g=0100000US&tid=ACSDP1Y2018.DP05),and [Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals)data, I could see how different counties are affected by the COVID 19 and possibly come up with some implications that these counties can follow to minimize the injuries, cases, and deaths.
